features:
  - title: Flexible I/O capabilities
    details: Open and operate on <font color="#D27D2D">NetCDF</font> and <font color="#D27D2D">Zarr</font> datasets directly. Or bring in data from other sources with ArchGDAL.jl, GRIBDatasets.jl, GeoJSON.jl, HDF5.jl, Shapefile.jl, GeoParquet.jl, etc.

  - title: Interoperability
    details: Well integrated with Julia's ecosystem, i.e., distributed operations are native. And plotting with <font color="#D27D2D">Makie.jl</font> is well supported.
  - title: Named dimensions and GroupBy(in memory)
    details: Apply operations over named dimensions, select values by labels and integers as well as efficient split-apply-combine operations with <font color="#D27D2D">groupby</font> via DimensionalData.jl.
    link: /UserGuide/group
  - title: Efficiency
    details: Efficient <font color="#D27D2D">mapslices(x) </font> and <font color="#D27D2D">mapCube</font> operations on huge multiple arrays, optimized for high-latency data access (object storage, compressed datasets).
