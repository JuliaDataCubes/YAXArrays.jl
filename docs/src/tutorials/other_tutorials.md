# Other tutorials

If you are interested in learning how to work with YAXArrays for different use cases you can follow along one of the following tutorials. 
- Currently the overview tutorial is located at [ESDLTutorials Repository](https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/ESDLTutorials)
- You can find further tutorial videos at the [EO College](https://eo-college.org/resource/large-scale-eo-data-handling/). Beware that the syntax in the video tutorials might be slightly changed. 
- the other tutorials are still work in progress.

## General overview of the functionality of YAXArrays

This tutorial provides a broad overview about the features of YAXArrays.

## Table-style iteration over YAXArrays
**Work in progress**

Sometimes you want to combine the data that is represented in the data cube with other datasets, which are best described as a data frame. 
In this tutorial you will learn how to use the Tables.jl interface to iterate over the data in the YAXArray.
